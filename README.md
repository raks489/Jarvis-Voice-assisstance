# I've created a complete AI chatbot with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture that handles basic conversations can use OpenAI's API for more complex responses. Here's what each component does:
Main Components:

Model (model.py):

Contains the chatbot's logic and response generation
Handles pattern matching for basic conversations
Integrates with OpenAI API for complex queries
Manages conversation history


View (view.py):

Handles user interface and input/output
Displays responses with a typing effect
Shows welcome and goodbye messages


Controller (controller.py):

Coordinates between model and view
Manages the chat loop
Processes user input and error handling



Additional Files:

OpenAI Client (utils/openai_client.py): Manages API integration
Conversation Patterns (data/conversation_patterns.json): Contains basic response patterns
Configuration (config/api_keys.json): For storing API keys

Key Features:

Pattern Matching: Recognizes common phrases and responds appropriately
API Integration: Falls back to OpenAI API for complex queries
Function Calls: Can execute functions like getting the time or date
Togglable AI: Users can switch between simple and AI-powered responses
Extensible Design: Easy to add new patterns and responses

To Run the Chatbot:

Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your OpenAI API key in environment variables or config file
Run the chatbot: python main.py
Chat naturally or use special commands like "help" or "exit"

The chatbot will respond to basic queries using pattern matching and will use the OpenAI API for more complex conversations when enabled.
